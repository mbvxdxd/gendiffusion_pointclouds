Last edit 13.03.24

### Meetings:
A) Time and Place:
Meetings are scheduled for every Wednesday from 08:00 to 17:30, with some flexibility. Initially, weekends are reserved for other school work. However, if necessary due to time constraints, we may consider utilizing some weekends as well.

We agreed to conduct a weekly status review every Wednesday, allocating 15-30 minutes to evaluate our progress. We'll use software called PLANE (link) to help organize the different project tasks.

It's important that we check in with each other about our well-being.

B)
If a group member is unable to attend, they must inform the group on the Discord server designated for the project.

C)
Notes from the meetings will be added to the logbook.md file after every meeting. The logbook is loacted on Git so all members have 24/7 access to it. 

D)
Initially, Henrik has been assigned the responsibility of recording meeting logs and communicating with our course leaders via email.

E)
We will first attempt to resolve issues through discussion. If a solution is not found, we will consult the guidance counselor.

A) We'll use Discord and PLANE for all communication.

B) We agreed to listen to everyone in the group.

### Workload, Expectations, and Ownership:
